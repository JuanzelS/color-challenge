## AI Reflection.

**Prompts I asked the AI:**
- "How to generate random hex color in JavaScript?"
- "Best way to reset state and generate new values in React?"

**How AI Helped Me:**
It helped me comprehend the structure of random hex color generation and provided guidance on how to manage component state and interaction logic.

I created the "Reset / Play Again" button by utilizing the onClick event to execute a code that regenerates the colors and resets the game state.
