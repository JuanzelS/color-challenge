## AI Reflection.

**Prompts I asked the AI:**
- "How to generate random hex color in JavaScript?"
- "How to compare color values in React onClick?"
- "Best way to reset state and generate new values in React?"

**How AI Helped Me:**
It helped me comprehend the structure of random hex color generation and provided guidance on how to manage component state and interaction logic.

On my own, I discovered how to utilize 'useEffect' to setup my component with random colors on first load.
